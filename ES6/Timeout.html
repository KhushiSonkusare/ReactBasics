        //setTimeout is a way to schedule a function to be executed after a certain period of time, without blocking the main thread.
        //The code inside setTimeout will be executed after the specified delay, allowing the rest of the code to run first.

        // call stack -> console.log("Started ...") -> setTimeout (pushed out to be handled by WEB API) -> console.log("End of script") -> setTimeout callback (after 2 seconds)
        // after time is completed, the callback function is pushed to the task queue
        // event loop checks the call stack, if it is empty, it will take the callback from the task queue and push it to the call stack
        // this is how JavaScript handles asynchronous code, allowing it to be non-blocking
